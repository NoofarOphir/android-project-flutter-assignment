Dry questions:

1. The class SnappingSheetController is used to implement the controller pattern in this library.
    It allows the developer to control snapping position, and allows the developer to stop the snapping.
    In addition, it allows the developer to get information about the snapping such as position, is the snapping active, and is it attached.

2. The parameters of snappingCurve and snappingDuration inside SnappingPosition control the way the sheet snaps into position.

3. Advantage of InkWell - Gives more design options such as borders and colors that appear on tap.
   Advantage of GestureDetector - Does not require material widget as ancestor which gives more flexibility in screen structure.
